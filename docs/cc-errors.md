# Compiler Errors

The C Compiler (`cc`) parses your C file and looks for syntactic
errors and if the input is syntactically correct, it looks for
semantic errors. If no semantic errors are found, then it outputs an
assembly language file.

/Syntactic/ errors are, roughly, grammatical errors. The compiler
cannot figure out what you're trying to say.  /Semantic/ errors are
roughly, errors of meaning. The compiler can figure out what you're
saying, but what you're saying does not make sense.
