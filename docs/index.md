# Introduction

This tutorial exposes you to many of the various errors you will
encounter when using a production C compiler like `gcc` for the first
time.

Recall that the C compilation process actually involves multiple
components -- preprocessor, compiler, assembler, and linker. Errors
can happen at any of these stages. In this tutorial, we will work with
examples that will trigger errors at specific stages so we can
recognize them and fix them.
